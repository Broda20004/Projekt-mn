The program performs image enhancement and tresholding. To obtain the best effect, cut-off values are being set for each object using a genetic algorithm. This algorithm is based on research conducted by H.D. Cheng, Yen-Hung Chen and Ying Sun, documented in 'A novel fuzzy entropy approach to image enhancement and thresholding'.
